        <h2>Ferrari: The Legendary Scuderia</h2>

        <p>Ferrari is one of the most iconic and successful teams in Formula 1 history. With 16 Constructors' Championships, they have built a legacy of excellence since their debut in 1950. In recent years, Ferrari has faced fierce competition but has remained a dominant force in the sport. The team’s resurgence in the mid-2010s with Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc marked their continuous battle for the title. Ferrari’s latest challenges include competing with Mercedes and Red Bull, but the Scuderia remains one of the most beloved and powerful teams in the sport. Despite not winning a Drivers' Championship since 2007, Ferrari is consistently pushing to return to the top.</p>

        <h2>Mercedes: Dominance in the Modern Era</h2>

        <p>Mercedes has been the dominant force in Formula 1 since its return to the sport in 2010. Under the leadership of team principal Toto Wolff, Mercedes achieved unprecedented success from 2014 to 2020, winning seven consecutive Constructors' Championships and seeing Lewis Hamilton secure six of his seven Drivers' Championships during this era. The team’s blend of engineering excellence, strategic depth, and Hamilton’s skill has made them nearly unstoppable in the hybrid era. However, Red Bull's rise in 2021 and the challenge from other teams in 2022 and 2023 has marked a more competitive phase. With the emergence of George Russell alongside Hamilton, Mercedes remains a formidable team, looking to return to the top of the podium in the new era of F1 racing
        <h2>Red Bull: The Innovators</h2>

        <p>Red Bull Racing has established itself as the team to beat in Formula 1. From their first Constructors' Championship in 2010 to their dominance in recent years, Red Bull has transformed Formula 1 with their cutting-edge engineering and unique approach to race strategy. The team's consistent success has been driven by the extraordinary talent of Max Verstappen, who won his first World Championship in 2021, followed by an exceptional 2022 season, where he won 15 races and broke several records. Red Bull’s ability to adapt to the ever-evolving F1 regulations, especially under the guidance of chief technical officer Adrian Newey, has kept them at the forefront. As of 2023, they continue to be the team to watch, having reasserted their dominance with Verstappen’s back-to-back championships.</p>
